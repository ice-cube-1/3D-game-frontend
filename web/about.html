        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
            Before you start playing, click on the screen to initialise the mouse pointer so you can turn as expected. To leave the game, use a keyboard shortcut or press Esc.<br/>
            The chat is activated by pressing t, and messages / command are sent with the enter key. When these are sent the chat is deactivated. <br/>
            When you first open the game, you will be called "unknown", along with anyone else not logged in. <br/>
            Type the command "\login [username] [password]" into the chat to create an account / login to an old account.<br/>
            To change your character's colour, use the command "/setcolor [R value], [B value], [G value]". <br/>
            Move using WASD, jump with space, click to attack. <br/>
            There are 5 rarities of items: common (grey), uncommon (green), rare (blue), epic (purple) and legendary (yellow). The rarer the item the more of an effect it has. <br/>
            Pressing E on a weapon / armour swaps it for the one currently equipped. Doing so on a potion consumes it, after which it respawns elsewhere. <br/>
            Attacking someone deals damage dependent on the rarity / type of weapon and the rarity of their armour. It is visible in the top right on the player list. <br/>
            The weapon type equipped also changes your attack range and speed. <br/>
            When you die you respawn elsewhere on the map. </br>
            The easiest way to get back to this is by typing "/help" into the chat.

        <h2>Current bugs</h2>
        <p>
            As of now I am unaware of any bugs, although I have done minimal testing so please let me know if you find any (there will be many)<br/>
            However, I haven't done much input validation etc and theres a few edge cases that are irritating to get stuck in, as well as badly formatted / confusing
            graphics. The ones I've encountered are below:
            <ul>
                <li>If you're not online when someone attacks you (so it's a background tab) then you may fall through the floor, at which point it is impossible to get back.
                To prevent this, please close the tab and re-login whenever you stop playing.</li>
                <li>The lighting on weapons can cause them to all look the same. The current workaround for this is to look at what you picked up in the chat.</li>
                <li>Other people's weapons are sometimes not correctly placed.</li>
                <li>People often don't face you when they should do so (roughly 90 degrees off, but need to do more research)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This project is an expansion of my <a href="https://github.com/ice-cube-1/multiplayer-game-gcse">GCSE CS project</a>, 
            with the main improvement being that it is now in 3D (WebGL graphics rendering, written in typescript) and the backend 
            now is written in Java (jetty). It is still very much in development, although I aim to have a working version by the
            beginning of September. <br/>
