        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
            Before you start playing, click on the screen to initialise the mouse pointer so you can turn as expected <br/>
            The chat is activated by pressing t, and messages / command are sent with the enter key. When these are sent the chat is deactivated. <br/>
            When you first open the game, you will be called "unknown", along with anyone else not logged in. <br/>
            Type the command "\login [username] [password]" into the chat to create an account / login to an old account.<br/>
            To change your character's colour, use the command "/setcolor [R value], [B value], [G value]". <br/>
            Move using WASD, jump with space, click to attack. <br/>
            There are 5 rarities of items: common (grey), uncommon (green), rare (blue), epic (purple) and legendary (yellow). The rarer the item the more of an effect it has <br/>
            Pressing E on a weapon / armour swaps it for the one currently equipped. Doing so on a potion consumes it, after which it respawns elsewhere <br/>
            Attacking someone deals damage dependent on the rarity / type of weapon and the rarity of their armour. It is visible in the top right on the player list <br/>
            The weapon type equipped also changes your attack range and speed. <br/>
            When you die you respawn elsewhere on the map </br>
        </p>
        <h2>Current bugs</h2>
        <p>
            As of now I am unaware of any bugs, although I have done minimal testing so please let me know if you find any (there will be many)<br/>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This project is an expansion of my <a href="https://github.com/ice-cube-1/multiplayer-game-gcse">GCSE CS project</a>, 
            with the main improvement being that it is now in 3D (WebGL graphics rendering, written in typescript) and the backend 
            now is written in Java (jetty). It is still very much in development, although I aim to have a working version by the
            beginning of September. <br/>
